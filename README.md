## Syllabus
### Course Objective
This course covers magnetic resonance imaging-based brain mapping tools, focusing on functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state fMRI. Lectures and literature review will be combined. Students will learn principles, methodologies, analysis, and sample applications, so that they are better equipped to understand the literature in MR-based neuroimaging and to conduct their own studies.
